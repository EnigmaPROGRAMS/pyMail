<h1>pyMail</h1>
<i>developed in good faith [ethical use only, no malicious intent]</i>
<h2>what is it?</h2>
<p><b>pyMail</b> is a tool developed by myself in order to be able to scrape a site for emails and have the ability to send an email to the emails you have found.<br><br>Upon running the program, you will be asked for a google acount login; this google account login is used to send the email in further stages.</p>
<h2>how can i use it?</h2>
<p>Using it is pretty simple, just make sure you have <b>BeautifulSoup</b> installed.<br><br>you can install it by using pip: <code>pip install bs4</code><br><br>you should have everything else installed by default - if you do not, you can just <code>pip</code> it<br><br>now just run the pyMail.py with the appropiate Python version: <code>python2 pyMail.py</code><br><i>[it might just be <code>python</code> for you]</i></p>
<h2>what's for the future?</h2>
<p>I plan on greatly improving the scraping feature, rather than just hitting the base page, I want the tool to travel through various pages picking up everything it can - I expect this to be implemented soon. Stay patient.</p>
